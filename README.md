# Sahi Pro | Test Automation

This portfolio showcases my skills using the Sahi Pro tool for automating web applications. It includes a sample test scenario for the login feature of the [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com) website.

### Test Case 1001: Valid Authentication

**Description:** This test case validates that the login feature accepts valid credentials and successfully logs in the user, redirecting them to the inventory page.

**Test Steps:**

1.  Login as `standard_user`.
2.  Click the "Login" button.
3.  Validate that the user is redirected to the inventory page.

### Test Case 1002: Invalid Authentication

**Description:** This test case verifies that the login feature rejects invalid credentials and returns an error message.

**Test Steps:**

1.  Login as `locked_out_user`.
2.  Click the "Login" button.
3.  Verify that an error message is displayed, indicating invalid authentication.


## Overview

While Sahi Pro offers a record and play feature that simplifies the initial script creation process, it's important to note that this approach has certain limitations.

The record and play feature in Sahi Pro generates test scripts based on the user interactions recorded during the testing process. However, the generated scripts may lack readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Here's an example of a script generated by Sahi Pro's record and play feature for the login feature of the [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website:

```javascript
    _setValue(_textbox("user-name"), "standard_user");
    _setPassword(_password("password"), "MgkKEQBUNh1BIgwL");
    _click(_submit("Login"));
    _click(_div("header_label"));
    _click(_submit("Open Menu"));
    _click(_link("Logout"));
 ```   

## Refactored Script

The generated script was refactored to improve readability, maintainability, and efficiency. The refactored version will follow the Sahi Pro Layers in Automation. Sahi Framework broadly breaks down automation code into 3 layers.

### Business Layer
This layer expresses business intent. It is agnostic of the UI, testing tool and interaction code. Refer to **`demo\tests\Authentication.s.csv`**

### Implementation Layer
This layer implements the business keywords specified in the previous layer. This is implemented with Sahi scripts (sah). Sahi script is based on javascript. Sahi script is parsed by Sahi and the parsed script is fully valid javascript which is executed by the rhino javascript engine. Refer to **`demo\functions\Authentication.sah`**

### Accessor Repository
With Sahi Pro, it is best practice to create Accessor Repository (AR). 

Accessor Repository (AR) is a central place to keep all Acessors (object identifiers). When an element changes, its identifier can be changed in a single place and it will reflect in all scripts. 

**`Authentication_AR.sah`**
``` js
var $USERNAME = _textbox("user-name");
var $PASSWORD = _password("password");
var $SUBMIT_LOGIN = _submit("Login");
var $ERROR_MESSAGE = _byXPath("//*[@data-test='error']");

var $SUBMIT_OPENMENU = _div("header_label");
var $LINK_LOGOUT = _link("Logout");
```
